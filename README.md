## Project Proposal – Morning Project Group 2

### Problem to Address:
When working for a business, you want to be able to share your information to potential customers or future employees/employers. The most common way this is done is through business cards. In order to do this, you have to make your cards look professional, and have them printed off. Even then, you have to always keep some cards on hand. In order to make this process quicker and more efficient, our app idea is a digital business card. The app will be able to create your own business card, and allow you to share it with others, as well as save their business card information.

### Activity - Login
Login page allowing access to your cards and saved cards - fully complete

### Activity - Main

### Activity - View Cards
Allows you to view created business cards and edit them or create new ones. From this view, you can also select to edit any of your cards. You will also have the option to share your cards, which will give you an ID for the card others input to save that card.

### Activity - Viewing Saved Cards
Here, you will be able to add new cards to save or view all cards that you have previously saved. You will also have the option to remove saved cards if need be. There will be a search/filter capabilities

### Activity - Add/Preview new cards
Preview new cards you want to add from other users. Once an id is entered a preview will be shown and you will be given the option to save the card.

### Risky Components:
Implementing a database to store all cards and user information, working with LinkedIn API to gather user information, Card customization as far as coloring, component movement and templates for different amounts of information displayed.
